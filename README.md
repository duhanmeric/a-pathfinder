First of all, you need to click a cell for starting point. That cell shouldnt be wall. <br/>
Secondly, you need to click second cell. That is your end point now. <br/>
Press the start button the see the purple path. <br/>
There is a input and save button to change the grid rows&cols at the same time. Because its a square. As default, square's size is 15x15. <br/>

If there is no path between selected points you will see a alertbox again with a text of "No solution for these points."
